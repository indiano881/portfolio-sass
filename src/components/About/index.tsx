            <h4>My Journey</h4>
            <p className="about__text" >My journey began when I realized how tired I was of working in the restaurant business. While I loved meeting new people every day, balancing evening and weekend shifts with family life became increasingly difficult. In 2022, I decided to change careers and enrolled in a professional education program (YrkeshÃ¶gskolan) in Stockholm to challenge myself and return to studying. So far, Iâ€™ve loved the process and am thrilled with my choice! Below a picture at my last job during Halloween!ðŸ˜Š</p>
