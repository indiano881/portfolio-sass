            <p>Hi there! I'm Davide Baldi, a passionate and dedicated Fullstack Web Developer based in Stockholm, Sweden, with a strong focus on creating elegant, user-friendly, and responsive websites.</p>
            
            <p>Web development is more than just a job for meâ€”it's a passion. I love turning ideas into reality, solving complex problems, and constantly learning new things. I focus on creating websites that are not only visually appealing but also provide real value to end users.</p>
            
            <p>Over the years, I've expanded my skills to include a significant part of the DevOps and AWS Cloud environment. I love working with Git, Docker, Kubernetes, and the entire AWS ecosystem! I find the concept of Serverless architecture particularly exciting!</p>

            <h4>My Journey</h4>
            <p>My journey began when I realized how tired I was of working in the restaurant business. While I loved meeting new people every day, balancing evening and weekend shifts with family life became increasingly difficult. In 2022, I decided to change careers and enrolled in a professional education program (YrkeshÃ¶gskolan) in Stockholm to challenge myself and return to studying. So far, Iâ€™ve loved the process and am thrilled with my choice! Below a picture at my last job during Halloween!ðŸ˜Š</p>
